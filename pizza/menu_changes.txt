        Menu changes... 
              You'll need to go into HTML view of menu.htm (located in the 
              includes file) in your favourite editor to make the changes 
              necessary to get the look you want. 
              Before each of these lines there is a comment explaining what 
              changes can be made - here are some examples: 

              Locate mymenu.mainmenuitemsize(122,18) - defines the width and 
              height in pixels of a menu item in the main menu. (The first one 
              to appear). 
              Locate mymenu.submenuitemsize(186,18) - defines the width and 
              height in pixels of the sub menu items.

              Locate mymenu.submenuplacing(0,0) - defines the position of the 
              sub menus in relation to the main menu.the first number will move 
              the sub menus more to the left, and the second number will move 
              the sub menus down. If the second number is negative the it will 
              move the sub menus up. 

              Locate 
              mymenu.mainborderimages("images/blackpixel.gif","images/blackpixel.gif","images/blackpixel.gif","images/blackpixel.gif")
              mymenu.mainbordercorners("images/blackpixel.gif","images/blackpixel.gif","images/blackpixel.gif","images/blackpixel.gif")
	 - use this function if you want to define a graphical border for 
              the main menu. If you do not want to define a border for the main 
              menu, just delete this line.The images are, in order, those which 
              are to the left, right, top and bottom of the main menu and the respective corners. In this 
              example we've used a black border with the blackpixel.gif.

	 Locate
	 mymenu.mainborderdimensions(1,1,1)
	 - this defines the width of the borders
              
	 Locate 
              mymenu.subborderimages("images/blackpixel.gif","images/blackpixel.gif","images/blackpixel.gif","images/blackpixel.gif")
              - as mainborderimages, but for all submenus so you can define a 
              different style for sub menus. If you wish to have the same style, 
              simply define the same images. Here we've used a black border.
 
              Locate mymenu.mainborderdimensions(1,1,1) - These are the 
              dimensions of the main menu borders. The first parameter is the 
              left width, the second the right width, and the third the height 
              at both top and bottom. If you did wish the top and bottom to have 
              different heights, you can of course pad with rows of transparent 
              pixels. Again, if you do not wish to define a border, simply 
              delete this line. 
              Locate mymenu.subborderdimensions(1,1,1) - As above but for all 
              sub menus. You may notice that the left width is rather large 
              compared to the rest of the widths. This is because it has to 
              accomodate the width of the "join" graphic. (That which "joins" a 
              menu to a sub menu). It is not necessary to define a "join" 
              graphic, but the option is there if you wish. 

              Locate mymenu.mainmenucolor("#EFECE2") - The color of the main 
              menu cells. Any valid HTML color is ok. 
              Locate mymenu.submenucolor("#EFECE2") - The color of the sub menu 
              cells. 
             
              Locate mymenu.netscapeadjust(3,3) - Unfortunately Netscape 4.7 
              does not behave quite so well with DHTML. If you find that the 
              text in the menu items is vertically aligned "top" in NN 4.7, then 
              adjusting these numbers will nudge it down by that number of 
              pixels. The first number is for the main menus, and the second for 
              the sub menus. 

	 Locate mymenu.definemainspacer("images/blackpixel.gif",1)
	 - The graphic that goes between menu items in the main menu. If you do not wish 
              to define one then simply leave this line blank. 
              mymenu.definesubspacer("images/blackpixel.gif",1)
 	 - As above but for sub menus.

              Locate
              mymenu.addMenu("home","<b>home</b>", "index.php")
mymenu.addMenu("main","<b>main</b>", "#")

// Please note, the following line of code is used to automatically create the links for the product sections
// If you do not want to use this feature, please delete this line of code in your includes/menu.htm file
// along with the corresponding section below.

mymenu.addMenu("products","<b>products</b>", "categories.php")

mymenu.addMenu("frontpage","<b>frontpage</b>", "#")
mymenu.addMenu("dreamweaver","<b>dreamweaver</b>", "#")
mymenu.addMenu("golive","<b>golive</b>", "#")
mymenu.addMenu("tools","<b>tools</b>", "#")
mymenu.addMenu("help","<b>help</b>", "#")
mymenu.addMenu("search","<b>search</b>", "search.php")
mymenu.addMenu("checkout","<b>checkout</b>", "cart.php")

              This is where you define the names that appear on the main menu. 
The links for your products is automatically generated.              
For simplicity sake it's a good idea to use the same names ie. 
              main is the name of the group that appears in the menu cell 
              with the title "main". We've put 9 headings but you can add 
              more in the same format or less by deleting the lines. The 
              parameters are in order, firstly, the name of the menu item (used 
              when defining sub menus), secondly, the text that appears in that 
              menu item, and thirdly the link from that that menu item. 
              Now to define the sub menu items. Here are a few of examples . . .
              
	 mymenu.addSubMenu("main", "", "<b>about us</b>", "about.php")

	 mymenu.addSubMenu("help", "tutorials", "<b>tutorials</b>", "#")

	 mymenu.addSubMenu("tutorials", "navigation", "<b>navigation</b>", "#")

	 mymenu.addSubMenu("navigation", "", "<b>navigation graphics</b>", "#")


              As you can see, the parameters are in order, firstly, the name of 
              the "parent" menu, secondly, the name of the "sub" menu if any, 
              thirdly, the text that will be displayed in the menu items, and 
              finally the link if any. As you can see, you can use HTML in the 
              text that appears in the menu items, as we have here with the <b> 
              tag to show in bold. Sub menu items need to be defined one group 
              at a time. For instance you can see that all the sub menus of 
              "instructions" are defined before starting to define any for 
              "webdesign". 


	 To change the colour of the links, you'll need to open the file stylesheet.css.
	 These lines dictate the colour of the links and the removal of the underline:
	 
	 A.menu:link {
	COLOR: #333333; TEXT-DECORATION: none
	 }
	 A.menu:active {
	COLOR: #333333; TEXT-DECORATION: none
	 }
	 A.menu:visited {
	COLOR: #333333; TEXT-DECORATION: none
	 }
	 A.menu:hover {
	COLOR: #ffffff; TEXT-DECORATION: none
	 }

	 The text links on the main page can be changed by altering these lines:

	 A:link  {
	color: #ffffff;
	text-decoration: none;
	 }

	 A:visited  {
	color: #ffffff;
	text-decoration: none;
	 }

	 A:active  {
	color: #ffffff;
	text-decoration: none;
	 }

	 A:hover  {
	color: #333333;
	text-decoration: none;
	 }

	 Any valid HTML color is ok - just make sure it contrasts with the background colour of the menu or page.
